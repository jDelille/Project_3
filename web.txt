**How does the internet work? 

-The internet is a network that connects computers around the world. In order for the
computers to communicate, they need to be connected to a router so they can access the 
internet. The internet is like a highway. The users are the cars, and the exits are 
individual websites. The road is a visual representaion for how the users get from one 
endpoints to another.


What happens when you click on a link? **

-When a user clicks on a link, they travel from one point to another. This is all made possible 
thanks to DNS. The browser will take the url that a link directs you too. Then, the browser talks 
to the DNS where the url is broken down into an IP address. With this IP address, a user can successfully
be redirected to the links endpoint.
